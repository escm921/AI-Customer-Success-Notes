# AI for Customer Success

Hi, I'm Marianne!  
I work with creative and marketing teams to help them embed AI tools in their workflows and drive adoption at scale.  

This space is where I collect notes, examples, and learnings around:
- AI adoption in creative workflows  
- Customer enablement and education strategies  
- Real-world use cases for tools like ElevenLabs, ChatGPT, and others  

I'm always exploring how to make AI approachable and valuable for every user from first demo to full rollout.
